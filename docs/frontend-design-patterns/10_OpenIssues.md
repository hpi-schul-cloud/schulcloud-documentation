## Workarounds

### Vuetify v-menu labels not accessible in Safari

A ![Vuetify issue](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/22540) required a ![workaround](https://github.com/hpi-schul-cloud/nuxt-client/pull/4050) on our part. Once the issue is resolved in Vuetify and the dependency is updated the commit can be reverted.
